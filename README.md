This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### 1. Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
``

### 2. Install Necessary Packages

For this project, you might need some additional packages. Here are a few you might consider:

- `axios` for making HTTP requests.
- `react-query` for managing server state.
- `tailwindcss` for styling (optional but useful).

Install these packages:

```bash
npm install axios react-query
```

If you want to use Tailwind CSS for styling, install it as follows:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Then configure Tailwind CSS by updating `tailwind.config.js` and adding Tailwind directives to your CSS.

### 3. Set Up Tailwind CSS

Add the following to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Create a `styles/globals.css` file and add the Tailwind directives:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Import the global CSS file in `pages/_app.js`:

```js
import '../styles/globals.css'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

export default MyApp
```


### 4. Run the Application

Now you can run your application and see the SEO tool in action:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3002` to see your app.
